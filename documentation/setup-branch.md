# Branch Setup Documentation

## Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch, follow this format:

`<type>/<number>-<name>`

Where:
- **`<type>`** is one of:
  - `feature` for new features
  - `bug` or `bugfix` for bug fixes
- **`<number>`** is a unique identifier (e.g., issue number or ticket ID)
- **`<name>`** is a brief, hyphenated description of the work

### Examples:
- `feature/1223-add-user-authentication`
- `bug/4567-fix-login-redirect`
- `bugfix/7890-resolve-memory-leak`

> **Note:** Always use lowercase letters and hyphens for separation in the branch name.
